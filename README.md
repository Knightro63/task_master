# Getting started

To get started with taskmaster add the package to your pubspec.yaml file.

# Usage

Taskmaster is able to operate statically by default with data that you provide through its parameters. There are two parts a BoardManager and ProjectManager.

The BoardManager will specialize in the logic and display of the boards and cards. 
The ProjectManager will specialize in the logic and display of the project cards.

To enable dynamic updates of the task manager data and upload to database, you must pass in callback functions through the parameters provided in the package.

## Board Manager

- Drag boards across the view to re-order them
- Add or remove cards when provided with callback functions
- Change color and name of board titles
- Provide database callbacks to dynamically update board

Example of a function to pass to BoardManager to push new board to database (Firebase Realtime Database):
\* Database class is defined in the package/example

```dart
onSubmit: (title, priority, notify) async {
    DateFormat dayFormatter = DateFormat('y-MM-dd hh:mm:ss');
    String date = dayFormatter
        .format(DateTime.now())
        .replaceAll(' ', 'T');

    Database.push(children: '$child/boards', data: {
    'createdBy': widget.currentUID,
    'dateCreated': date,
    'title': title,
    'priority': priority,
    'notify': notify
    });

    setState(() {});
},
```

## Project Manager

- Create, delete and update projects using the 'plus' button
- View, edit and create labels to use for the project tasks
- Define behavior for project completion
- Supports addition of point system when provided with callbacks
- Provide database callbacks to dynamically update projects

Example of a function to pass to ProjectManager to push new board to database (Firebase Realtime Database):
\* Database class is defined in the package/example

```dart
onSubmit: (title, image, date, color) async {
    DateFormat dayFormatter = DateFormat('y-MM-dd hh:mm:ss');
    String createdDate =
        dayFormatter.format(DateTime.now()).replaceAll(' ', 'T');

    Database.push(children: '$child/', data: {
        'department': currentEpic,
        'createdBy': "example",
        'dateCreated': createdDate,
        'dueDate': (date != '') ? date : null,
        'title': title,
        'image': (image == ' ') ? 'temp' : image,
        'color': color,
    });
},
```
